# Angular Utilities

This actually taken from Jprotector/protector-jvm project. 
I applied in utilities. 
As they dont come with maven distribution, I needed to use them. (so I havn't remove their copyright)
I am modifying some function again you can use this in your project. 

I will enrich more scripts so that it is useful to support more typr of angular apps

adding 1.5.8 angular base libraries in resources :  https://code.angularjs.org/
